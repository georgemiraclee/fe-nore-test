Nore FE Test
Create an application based on:
Figma UI Design
Features:
User can see a list of offices.
User can create an office with location and contact information.
User can edit an office.
User can delete an office.
Requirements:
Create application using React Vite with typescript.
You can use mocked API functions that we already provided to create, read, update, and delete the data.
You have to use:
react-query to fetch data from an API (in this case, you will fetch from mocked data that we already provided).
react-hook-form to manage a form such as input state, submitting, and form validation.
You allowed to use a Component library (Material UI, etc), CSS Framework (Tailwind, etc), or Vanilla CSS.
Good luck!
Please send your github repository URL when you are done.
